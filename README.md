# Form Handling Web Application

## Description
This repository contains a simple web application demonstrating form handling using HTML and Servlets. Users can submit a form with various input fields, and the data is processed by a Java servlet to generate a dynamic HTML response.

## Usage
1. Open the HTML file, `index.html`, in a web browser.
2. Fill out the form fields with the desired information.
3. Click the "enviar" (send) button.
4. The submitted data will be processed by the servlet, and the results will be displayed on a dynamically generated HTML page.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have a Java web server, such as Apache Tomcat, installed and configured.
2. Deploy the application by placing the project directory in the server's `webapps` folder.
3. Start the server.

## Dependencies
This application has the following dependencies:
- Java Servlet API
- Java web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat)

## How It Works
1. When the form is submitted, a POST request is sent to the designated Servlet.
2. The servlet retrieves or creates a session and processes the submitted form data.
3. The servlet generates an HTML response dynamically, displaying the processed data.
